# Section 1: Defines how to setup the infrastructure pieces for
# the cluster. It specifies things like:
#   - Which cloud type to use?
#   - Which environment to use. (environments are defined in a seperate file).
#   - what is the size of the cluster to spin up and the template to use to spin up cluster.
#     (A template defines how the cluster is spun up. Whether instances are behind a LB, do they
#      use existing security groups or create newones, etc.)
